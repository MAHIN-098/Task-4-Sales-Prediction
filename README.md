# Task-4-Sales-Prediction
Steps to Run the Project
1)Upload & Load Data
2)Upload Car sale purchasing.csv using files.upload().
3)Load the dataset using pd.read_csv().
4)Train-Test Split:
Split data into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split().

Model Training & Evaluation
1)Train a Random Forest Regressor using a Pipeline.
2)Compute Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) on test data.

Code Structure
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and outlier removal.
Feature Engineering: Extracting month information.
Training: Random Forest Regressor with a pipeline.
Evaluation: Error metrics and R² score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance.
